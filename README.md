## Contributions // acknowledgements
The design and the basic app architecture was developed by [@fpegios](https://github.com/fpegios) in collaboration with [@frksteenhoff](https://www.github.com/frksteenhoff) and Marianna Tzachsan for a DTU course in the fall of 2018. Most of the logic has been redone, but the design has been reused to a large extent.
